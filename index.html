                    <p><strong>Monthly Reflections</strong></p>
                    <p>August: Coordinated our school’s 2018 Alumni challenge in which HISD encouraged everyone that graduated from an HISD school to wear the school shirt or colors of the school you graduated from.  I coordinated with a friend of mine in the neighborhood that creates shirts and he created an Austin High Alumni t-shirt that he sold over 200 shirts to different teachers, faculty, and community members that graduated from Austin High School.</p>
                    <p>September: Because Austin High is in a temporary campus and our cafeteria cannot hold our entire school during lunch, I began to allow and encouraged other teachers to allow students into their classrooms during the students’ lunch.</p>
                    <p>October: Continued to allow students have lunch in teachers’ classes.  Also helped decorate our building and my class for Halloween.  Mustang Pride committee decorated room for faculty Halloween luncheon and Austin High School with Principal Guerrero’s approval paid for lunch for staff for Halloween luncheon.</p>
                    <p>November: Coordinated voting drive that registered over 60 Austin High Students and approximately 20 faculty and staff.  Coordinated with Baker Ripley House to host, drive (buses), and feed approximately 30 of Austin’s students and faculty to go vote during the November General election (early voting).  Austin High School had Kelly’s Country Kitchen cater our faculty Thanksgiving luncheon.</p>
                    <p>December: Organized faculty and staff Christmas party at Joystix Game Room in Downtown Houston.  We had Pink’s Pizza cater the event.  We organized and set up the entire event where the establishment opened up their game room so all of our staff including our staff’s children could play video games for free.  Our school principal approved the funding for the event.</p>
                    <p>January: As Austin High’s Houston Federation of Teachers union steward and culture specialist, I organized Austin teachers along with many other teachers from around the district to walk in the Martin Luther King Jr. Parade and show our unity in advocating for equitable education for all of our students.</p>
                    <p>February: For Black History Month, I along with the Black American Club and the Mustang Pride Committee, organized different vendors to provide our luncheon for Black History Month.  I along with others also set up and served during the luncheon. </p>
                    <p>March: Currently coordinating our Cinco de Mayo faculty luncheon and our Austin High school end of the year social gathering.</p>
                    <p><strong>Facilitation of Learning and Development</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><font size="4">Fought alongside hundreds of other teachers, community, and school board members to implement teachers’ step increase which essentially gave most teachers a very minimal pay increase to the previous year.</font></li>
                        <li><font size="4">Participated in monthly Project Advisory Team meetings informing staff of progress with our new building being built.  Worked with building company and administration on placement of windows and doors that better suit teachers in certain teaching preps.</font></li>
                        <li><font size="4">Participated in monthly Shared Decision Making Committee meetings coordinating with administration over new scheduling for the next year, ensuring teachers’ input was included. We discussed a new block schedule that would increase individual planning time for each teacher and in turn would help with campus morale.  As a member of the Security and Safety committee, I  would ensure teaching members opinions and concerns are addressed at the campus level regarding security and safety concerns.</font></li>

					<p>Not only have I had the pleasure of being a teacher at Stephen F. Austin High School for the past 13 years, I am also honored to have graduated from Austin High School in 1993.  I also graduated from all of Austin’s feeder schools as well; Cage Elementary and Jackson Middle schools.</p>
                    <p>Being a teacher at Austin High in the East End community, a neighborhood in which I was raised has really been an exhilarating experience for me.  In my years here at Austin, my colleagues have elected me to our school’s Shared Decision-Making Committee (SDMC) for the past nine years.  Even more of any honor, for the past five years among the district’s 12,000 teachers, my fellow teacher colleagues have elected me along with 18 other teachers to represent them on our District Advisory Committee (DAC).

                <div class="col-lg-5 about-me-p">
					<p>Considering in 1983 Austin High School created the first Teaching Profession Magnet program in the country, graduating from Austin as a part of this program and now being able to come back to this same school as a teacher that opened so many doors and provided so many opportunities for me, truly has been a remarkable experience that I cherish every day.  Last year I completed my Master’s degree from the University of Houston in Administration and Supervision; succesfully passing my Principal’s certification exam. With this new accomplishment, I look forward to continuing to follow my dreams of impacting as many students as possible and facilitating a positive and successful learning environment in the best way possible to fit each individual student’s needs. </p>
